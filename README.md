# DSA Compiler - Root Config
### Deployed URL:
```
https://dsa-compiler-root-config.netlify.app/
 ```
This project is the root configuration for a **Single-SPA** micro-frontend architecture. It integrates various front-end applications such as problem viewer and editor, dynamically loaded based on routing configuration.

## Features

- **Single-SPA Configuration**: Manages routing and dynamically loads micro-frontends based on path mappings.
- **Layout Management**: Uses a layout engine to construct routes and applications based on a `single-spa-layout` template.
- **Module Loading**: Imports required modules like React and ReactDOM from CDNs to minimize bundle size.
- **Import Map Overrides**: Supports import map overrides during development to load specific versions of dependencies.

## Installation
